        <h1>Lemon Chicken with Pasta</h1>
        
        <p>As an empty nester, I have gradually learned to make a few adjustments to cooking for just the two of us. It’s a process, especially if you have been cooking for a family for many years. I confess that I am surprised how much fun I am having cooking just for two. I hope you will, too!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lemon</li>

            <li>2 chicken breast halves with skin and bones (about 1 1/4 pounds)</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

            <li>2 pinches ground black pepper</li>

            <li>1/3 cup plain yogurt</li>

            <li>1/2 small red onion, cut into thin wedges</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <li>1/2 cup chicken stock or white wine</li>

            <li>1 cup small pasta such as cavatelli, orzo, or ditalini</li>

            <li>1/4 cup chopped chopped parsley</li>
            
            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro </li>

            <li>1/2 cup pitted green olives halved or quartered</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Cut the lemon</h3>
        <p>Slice half of the lemon into rounds and use the other half to squeeze over the chicken.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Marinate the Chicken</h3>
        <p>Place the chicken in a shallow dish. Sprinkle both sides with salt and a few pinches of pepper. Squeeze the juice from the lemon half over the chicken and spread it with the yogurt. Turn the chicken a few times in the yogurt, and let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes or covered in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Preheat the oven</h3>
        <p>Set an oven rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Bake the chicken</h3>
        <p>In the bottom of an ovenproof skillet or small roasting pan, scatter the onion wedges and lemon slices. Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper.Place the chicken on top with the skin side up and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the skin is golden and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers 165°F. (Exact cooking time depends upon the size of the breasts.)</p>
        
        <h3>Step 5: While the chicken roasts, cook the pasta</h3>
        <p>In a large saucepan, bring 5 to 6 cups salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 10 to 12 minutes (or according to the package directions) until tender. Drain in a sieve.</p>

        <h4>Step 6: Stir in stock or wine, add the pasta, herbs, and olives to the pan</h3>
        <p>Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and stir in the stock or wine. Stir in the pasta, parsley, cilantro, and olives. Spoon it onto 2 plates and set the chicken on top.</p>
